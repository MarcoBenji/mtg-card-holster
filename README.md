# "DRAW, go"
This was a hackathon project, to try and teach myself a new language all in one day.  This
was completed from beginning to end during a normal business day.  This MS will allow you to 
create/delete/query/queryList/hit a public api to retrieve data.  All thanks to the awesome game
magic the gathering for giving me a great place to start for this project.
